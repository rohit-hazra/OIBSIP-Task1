# 📱 Simple Calculator

A modern, responsive, and user-friendly web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project demonstrates clean UI design, core JavaScript logic, and real-world calculator functionality, suitable for learning, showcasing, or extending further.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This calculator application allows users to perform basic and advanced arithmetic operations with a smooth and intuitive interface.
It supports real-time expression display, accurate calculations, and mobile responsiveness.

The project is designed with clarity, simplicity, and usability in mind, making it ideal for beginners as well as developers practicing front-end fundamentals.

## ✨ Features

**Basic Arithmetic Operations**

- Addition (+)

- Subtraction (−)

- Multiplication (×)

- Division (÷)

**Advanced Operations**

- Percentage (%)

- Square Root (√)

- Parentheses for grouped expressions

- Toggle sign (±)

**Memory Functionality**

- ans button to reuse the last calculated result

**Expression Display**

- Shows the full mathematical expression

- Displays the final computed result separately

**Error Handling**

- Prevents invalid calculations

- Displays Error for undefined or invalid expressions

**Responsive Design**

- Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Users click number and operator buttons to build an expression.

2. The expression is displayed in real time.

3. When ENTER is pressed:

    - The expression is safely evaluated.

    - Percentage values are converted into valid mathematical expressions.

    - The result is calculated and displayed.

4. The ans button allows reuse of the previous result in a new calculation.

5. Invalid operations are caught and handled gracefully.
